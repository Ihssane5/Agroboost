## Project Overview

Agroboost offers three innovative services designed to enhance agricultural practices through advanced technology and AI. These services include Fertify, Fertibot, and PlantGuard.

üå± Fertify : 

Fertify is a cutting-edge fertilizer recommendation tool that helps farmers optimize their use of fertilizers based on various factors. those factors ranges from
soil type, crop type, environmental conditions, to recommend the most suitable fertilizers.


ü§ñ Fertibot :

Fertibot is an intelligent chatbot designed to provide information and support related to OCP Group‚Äôs fertilizers. It acts as a virtual assistant to answer queries and offer guidance on fertilizer-related topics. 

ü™¥ PlantGuard :

PlantGuard is an advanced system for monitoring plant health. It leverages AI and image analysis to detect and address plant disease before they become critical. 

ü§ù Assistance Chatbot : 
The Assistance Chatbot provides essential information for easy navigation of Agroboost's services.


## Technical Overview

Agroboost leverages state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques and advanced architectures to deliver its services. Below is a technical description of the methods and technologies used in each service: Fertify, Fertibot, PlantGuard and the assistane chatbot.

### Fertify 

üå± **Fertify** uses machine learning models to provide optimized fertilizer recommendations. The technical components include:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
  - **Data Collection:**
  the dataset was available in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction. It contains data of various fertilizers information.This data was by researching various websites and sources. 
  - **Feature Engineering:**
   Extracts relevant features and preprocesses data for model training, including normalization and scaling.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - **Classification Models:** Random Forest Classifier was used for Recommending the best fertilizer based on different canditions like sol type and crop type...

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - **Performance Metrics:**  the evaluation of model performance were determined by  accuracy, precision, and recall.

check this notebook for more details: [Fertify Notebook](./EDA/Fertify.ipynb)

### FertiBot

ü§ñ **Fertibot** is powered by natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interact with users regarding fertilizer-related queries. Key technologies include:

- **NLP Techniques:**
  - **Language Models:** the mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 was used for generating human like text based on context provided.
  - **RAG:** retrieval augmented generation was used in order to provide context from pdf documents about OCP's Fertilizer to the language model in order to generate accurate and human like text.
  - **Chunking:**  the text extracted from the pdf documents was splitted, in order to obtain context focused chunks and improve relevance when retrieving.
  - **Vector Database:** Chroma Db was used in order to store embeddings of chunks from pdf documents about OCP's Fertilizer.

  The pdf used are available in OCP Offcial Website :

### PlantGuard

ü™¥ **PlantGuard** employs image analysis and AI techniques to monitor plant health and detect disease based on plant's leaf. The technical aspects include:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
  - **Data Collection:**
  the dataset was available in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset
  . This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.
- **Image Processing and Analysis:**
  - **Computer Vision Models:** Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and plant's disease detection.

- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - **Classification Algorithms:** Implements classification algorithms to detect diseases.

### Assistance Chatbot

ü§ù **The Assistance Chatbot** provides essential information for easy navigation of Agroboost's services. 
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
  - **Data Collection:**
  the dataset use for training  the MLP Classifier was manually created, it was orginized into a json file of itents each was carectarized with a tag,  a list of questions, and a list of possible answers.
  [intents.json](./data/intents.json).

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - **Classification Models:** an mlp classifier was trained on tags prediction task using the available questions. 
  you can check [train.py](./src/train.py) for more informations of the training process.

- **NLP Techniques:**
  - **Tokenization:** the  user's question was tokenized into tokens.
  - **Stemming:** the tokens were stemmed, converted to their root form in order to cover a wide range of words.
  - **Bag_of_Words:** a vector representation of text data for machine learning models. The idea is to create a "bag" of words from a text corpus with a focus on the presence of words.

 ## Technology Stack
 - **Front-End:** Html,Css,Js,Bootstrap, This combination provided a solid foundation for building responsive and interactive web pages.
  - **Integration:** ML model's integration was done using Flask as the web framework. Flask handled the API endpoints, allowing the model to make real-time predictions and process data on the server side.
- **AI Stack:**
  - **Fertify:** sklearn package was used  to develop the fertilizer recommendation system.
  - **FertiBot:** hugging face ecosystem was used for llm calling ,langchain  framework for handling essential task such as  ChromeDb and pdf content handling, beside handling the interaction with the llm.
  - **PlantGuard:** TensorFlow was used as the Framework for developping the CNN Model.
  - **The Assistance Chatbot:** The ChatBot was build using Pytorch Frameworks for the classifier.
